Create an page with a listing of Etsy items. 

You can reference this page for layout - https://www.etsy.com/search?q=beer

You do NOT need to worry about the left column and if you want you can do 4 across instead of 3 like in the following screenshot: http://cl.ly/image/0g12350c0x3U

I would like to see you include a header & footer on the page just to give it some flair.

Here is a link to the payload - https://gist.github.com/twhitacre/9c0b614cca906fa43e49

There are 25 items in there and they all should be listed out on the page.

Please comment with a link to either your GH-Pages or your project repo.
